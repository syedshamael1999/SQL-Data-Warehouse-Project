## 🏛️ Data Architecture
This project’s data architecture is built on the Medallion Architecture, utilizing Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers: 
- 🥉 **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw unprocessed data from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database.
- 🥈 **Silver Layer**: Includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
- 🥇 **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a Star Schema, optimized for reporting and analytics.

(The architecture was designed using Draw.io for visualization and documentation.)
